Instructions for dbRestore users                    Last Updated 08/09/2007
--------------------------------

I - Adding the restore package to your IOC application:
-------------------------------------------------------

(1) Add RESTORE to configure/RELEASE and clean/rebuild configure:

RESTORE=/afs/slac/g/lcls/build/epics/modules/restore/<version>

(2) Link the restore library into your app by adding to xxxApp/src/Makefile:

   xxx_LIBS += restore

(3) Add the following .dbd files to xxxApp/src/Makefile 
    or to xxxApp/src/xxxInclude.dbd:

   xxx_DBD += dbRestore.dbd

II - Modifying your IOC databases:
----------------------------------

(1) In your database files, for the setpoint records (ao, bo, mbbo, etc)
    that will be restored,replace "DOL" fields with "VAL" fields for  default 
    values.  Note that DOL will overwrite the restored value, VAL will not.  

(2) If restoring fields of a calc or sub record, replace constant "INPA" 
    fields with "A" fields for default values.

(3) Set "PINI=YES" for all setpoint records so that records are not invalid
    after iocInit is finished.

III - Setting up ChannelWatcher to Save Setpoints
-------------------------------------------------
(1) Follow instructions in $(TOOLS)/ChannelWatcher/README to add setpoints
    to ChannelWatcher for monitoring and restore file update.

IV - Adding dbRestore to your IOC startup file:
-----------------------------------------------

(1) For RTEMS IOCs, add this nfsMount command to your startup file after 
    epicsEnvSet<Dev,Dmz,Prod> is invoked:

   nfsMount(getenv("NFS_FILE_SYSTEM"),getenv("NFS_IOC_DATA"),"/dat")

(2) For scaler setpoint restore, in your ioc startup file, add this line 
    after databases are loaded and before iocInit:
   
    Soft IOC:
   dbRestore("${IOC_DATA}/<ioc-name>/<iocname>.sav", "<iocname>", -1)
    RTEMS IOC:
   dbRestore("/dat/<ioc-name>/<iocname>.sav",0,-1)

   The second argument is the ioc name.  For soft IOCs, it must be provided.
   For RTEMS IOCs, it is set to 0 so the host name is used.
   The third argument is the time allowed to retry until the file open and
   read is successful.  -1 means retry forever.  0 means try only once.  

(3) For waveform restore, TBD.
